# Running the Projects
Each project is contained in its own file with a .js extension. To run a project, simply open the corresponding file in a JavaScript environment, such as a browser console or Node.js.

Alternatively, you can copy the code from each project file and paste it into an online JavaScript editor or IDE, such as CodePen or JSFiddle.
